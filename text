At (time), the universe will cool to 1.7 x 10^12 K, the Hagedorn temperature. quark matter will condense into hadrons. Below that temperature, the quarks that make up our body will be locked away in hadrons, breaking the chemistry that allows us to breathe, live, and think. Quantum chromodynamics as we know it will come to a stop.

In 10^12 years, star formation as we know it will
