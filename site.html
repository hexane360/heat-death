        "Can you tell me how the universe began?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "As far as we know, the universe began at <span class="dim">1 × 10<sup>-13</sup> quectoseconds</span>.
        By <span class="dim">1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> qs</span>,
        the Grand Unified Theory separated into the three fundamental forces we know today: The Strong force,
        the Gravitational force, and the Electroweak force. But the Universe wasn't done. At the instant of the Big Bang,
        the observable universe was only <span class="dim">1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> qm</span> apart. In the first
        <span class="dim">0.001 qs</span>, our portion of the Universe rapidly expanded to become
        <span class="dim">1 × 10<sup>30</sup> qm</span> apart. That's so big it would take us
        <span class="dim">3.3 × 10<sup>21</sup> qs</span> to cross."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "But we only live for <span class="dim">100 <span class="unit">qs</span></span>!<br>
        If we're lucky!"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "It's worse than that. The Universe is still constantly expanding. By the time you make it across, the universe could be
        billions of times larger. It probably won't even be the same universe you know. Below 10<sup>15</sup> K, the fundamental
        forces of the universe will change, and the electroweak force will split into two unrecognizable forces."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "What do you mean by 'unrecognizable'?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "Well, as you know, the Universe is basically a plasma of quarks in a sea of gluons. The electroweak force bonds these
        quarks into molecules which create our bodies. In <span class="dim">10<sup>18</sup> qs</span>, however, the electroweak
        force will no longer act over long distances. Even worse, the two of the three bosons which mediate the electroweak force
        will all but dissapear."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "What happens then?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "Then the Universe will end. Without the electroweak interaction, there's no way for chemistry to function. In essence,
        the Universe ceases to support life, its particles become spread thin over unimaginable amounts of space, and it dies a
        cold, dark death."

        "This article says that at <span class="dim">1 × 10<sup>17</sup> zs</span>, the temperature of the Universe will drop below
        1.7&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;K, and the quarks which make up our body will begin to condense into
        "hadrons". Once this happens, the chemistry we rely on to breathe, live, and think will no longer be possible.
        Quantum chromodynamics as we know it will come to a stop."

        "Doesn't matter to me. I'll be long dead."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "It says here: "Scientists are still attempting to synthesize hadrons in the lab, but it's extremely difficult to cool quarks
        to temperatures low enough to bind them together. Whatever properties hadrons turn out to have, one thing is clear: The
        Universe as we know it will be a much different place."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "Couldn't we just keep a bunch of space heaters around?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "I don't think so. Eventually we'll run out of energy to power them with. The Second Law of Thermodynamics means
        that eventually all temperatures must equalize. No, our time here is limited."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "Do you think life could happen afterwards?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "I wouldn't bet on it. There just won't be enough free energy left in the future."
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "Here, look what it says: 'By <span class="dim">10<sup>21</sup> zs</span> (a hundred billion billion zs!), more than 99% of all these hadrons will
        be annihilated by antihadrons.'"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "So, not only will every quark in our body be unrecognizable, but 99% of them will be gone altogether?"
      </p>
      <p class="text diag1">
        "And then it looks like the same will happen with leptons. And photons."

        "...and the cosmic background radiation of the Universe is measured to be 2.725 Kelvin,
        indicating that matter and electro-magnetic radiation decoupled when the universe was approximately
        <span class="dim">1.2 × 10<sup>13</sup> s</span> old, meaning the universe became transparent to light,
        leading to what scientists call the dark ages, culminating in the formation of stable hydrogen and
        in a few hundred million years stars and galaxies, and this was all made possible by the asymmetry
        between matter and antimatter long theorized by physicists but only experimentally verified recently,
        the presence of this asymmetry implies that there was much more matter at the beginning of the universe,
        which annihilated as the temperature of the universe steadily dropped, which lowered the equilibrium constant
        for the reaction of energy to form matter and antimatter, all as the observable universe adiabatically expanded
        to the current size, from an initial size of <span class="dim">10<sup>-35</sup> m</span> to its current size of
        <span class="dim">10<sup>27</sup> meters</span> (93 billion light years) of observable space, meaning the whole
        universe could be much bigger, even infinite, and other components of it could have domain walls in between,
        separating parts of the universe that spotaneously broke symmetry in different ways, because all proccesses in
        the universe are local, including the processes that determine its fundamental laws, except possibly for the
        process that created the universe in the first place, because it doesn't make sense to talk about units of time
        before 1 Planck time (<span class="dim">10<sup>-43</sup> s</span>), at least without a working model of quantum
        gravity, like the ABEGHHK'tH mechanism for simultaneous symmetry breaking developed by Brout, Englert, Higgs,
        Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, 't Hooft, which allows for the development of massless photons and massive W & Z bosons
        from a unified electroweak force..."

      <p class="text diag2">"Yeah?"</p>
      <p class="text diag1">"What are you doing after class?"</p>
      <p class="text diag2">"Dunno."</p>
      <p class="text diag2">"Hey, do you think life existed before us?"</p>
      <p class="text diag1">"Like life on other planets?"</p>
      <p class="text diag2">"No, like life that's completely different from us. Life not made of carbon and atoms and molecules."</p>
      <p class="text diag1">"Oh. Probably not."</p>
      <p class="text diag2">
        "Like imagine right after the big bang. Could there have been life that evolved, grew, and died before us?"

        "Well, pretty soon now everything will be gone but black holes. Didn't you hear the professor?
