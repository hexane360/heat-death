Electroweak epoch:

- Electroweak force (W, Z & photon) mediated
- Ends when weak force separates from electromagnetic force

"Can you tell me how the universe began?"

"As far as we know, the universe began at 1E-13 quectoseconds [1E-43 s]. By 1E-05 qs, the Grand Unified Theory separated into the three fundamental forces we know today: The Strong force, the Gravitational force, and the Electroweak force. But the Universe wasn't done. At the instant of the Big Bang, the observable universe was only 1E-5 qm apart. In the first 0.001 qs, our portion of the Universe rapidly expanded to become 1E30 qm apart."

Quark epoch:

- Strong force (gluon) mediated
- ends in dark age

"Life as we know it began 1 billion zeptoseconds ago, 12 billion zs since the creation of the Universe. Now try to imagine one million billion zs from now. At that time, the universe will cool to 1.7 x 10^12 K, the Hagedorn temperature. When this happens, quark matter will condense into hadrons. From that point on, the quarks (red, green, and blue) that make up our body will be locked away in theoretical particles called "hadrons", breaking the chemistry that allows us to breathe, live, and think. Quantum chromodynamics as we know it will come to a stop."

"But what happens then? What *are* hadrons?"

"We don't really know. Scientists have just been able to cool matter enough to form hadrons, but in a million billion zs, almost all quarks in the universe 

"..."

"Things don't stop there. On unimaginably long timescales, (one billion billion zs!), most of those hadrons will be annihilated by their anti-matter counterparts. 


Human epoch:

In 10^12 years, star formation as we know it will have ceased.
